## Lab Questions

### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?

### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?

### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
The largest number a two bit adder can handle is 3 (11 in binary). A two bit adder can handle the sum of 3 and 3 which would give the output 6 (110), if you were to go over this number then this would lead to overflow.
